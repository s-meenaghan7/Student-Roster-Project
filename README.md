# Student-Roster-Project
University project written in C++. 

This project served as the final project for a scipting & programming class.
This project demonstates competency and understanding of the C++ programming language, as well as general programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, the use of functions, pointers, and data types including enumerated types.


The program uses two classes: Student and Roster. Student objects are added to a class Roster (like a database).
The program first initializes an instance of the Roster class. Then, the program parses an array (studentData) containing 5 long strings, each in coma-delimited format. The parseAdd() function creates a new Student object, parses each string to set each Student's private variables (attributes) to those found as they are in each string.


After parsing the studentData array for the values for each Student object, the roster is displayed, showing the roster of 5 students and their values (i.e. studentID, firstName, lastName, email, age, average days to complete a course (for 3 courses), and an enumerated type for each student's degreeProgram, being one of SECURITY, NETWORK, or SOFTWARE.

Then, several functions are performed on the data. (to be continuted...)
